# Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrency is a form of currency that uses digital files as money. This form of currency can be exchanged online for various goods and services. As opposed to central banking systems, cryptocurrencies use decentralized control using a blockchain, which is considered a public financial transaction database. 

Accountability Accounting, one of our most important clients, wants to offer their clients a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. The company, however, does not have enough knowledge about crypto, so they reached out to us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we are working with is not ideal, so we will need to process it to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output, I have decided to use unsupervised machine learning. I have reprocessed the data, applied the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Algorithm to reduce the data, clustered the data using the K-Means Algorithm, and then created the visuals to display the results, suitable for a more standardized setting.
